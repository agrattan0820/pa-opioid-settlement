Billions of dollars in settlements from pharmaceutical companies are being sent to states across the US. According to the [PA Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust](https://www.paopioidtrust.org), $1.07 billion will be distributed to local Pennsylvania counties.

This website aims to visualize the money spent as well as the money not spent so far by PA counties on remediation efforts aimed to curb the opioid crisis.
